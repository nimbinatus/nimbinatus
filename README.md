### $ whoami

I'm a developer advocate and a devops fanatic. 

You'll often find me at my local meetups like [Austin DevOps](https://github.com/Austin-Devops) and [Cloud Austin](https://www.meetup.com/CloudAustin/). Want to know where I'm going to be next or curious regarding what I talk about? I've got my recent talks up and my upcoming talks on [my speaking portfolio](https://speaking.nimbinatus.com).

Need to get in touch? The best way to do that is to find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nimbinatus) or contact me through the email address I have here on GitHub.

I'm also the curator for [A Minute on the Mic](https://aminuteonthemic.com/). We're on hiatus for a little while as a lot of folks are a bit swamped right now. Want to be on A Minute on the Mic, though? Come talk with me!

You can check out [my blog](https://nimbinatus.com), but I'm notoriously bad at keeping it updated. You probably would have better luck [following me on Dev.to](https://dev.to/nimbinatus) :)
